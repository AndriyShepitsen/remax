			<h1>Deciding Where to Live </h1>
			<hr/>
				<p>If you're unfamiliar with the area where you’re moving, your buyer’s agent is an invaluable resource. He or she can offer insider knowledge on neighborhoods, schools, access to recreation and shopping districts, and the many other details on local neighborhoods and subdivisions.</p>
				<p>It’s important to have a clear picture on the features that matter most to you in a home or location. Creating a list of “must haves” and flexible "nice-to-haves" from the start will make things a lot easier for you.</p>
			<ol>
			<h5>Factors to consider:</h5>	
				<li>
					<h5>Size of home</h5>
					<p>-square footage, number of bathrooms, rooms, etc.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>Home features</h5>
					<p>–updated fixtures/appliances, property size, garage, storage, etc.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>Location </h5>
					<p>– proximity to schools, open space, entertainment, work, etc.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>Neighborhood </h5>
					<p>– older or newer homes? Families, retirees or singles?</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>Room to grow</h5>
					<p>– planning to have more children?</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5>Condition </h5>
					<p>– move-in ready or a less expensive home in need of improvements?</p>
				</li>
				<p>Your buyer's agent can offer advice on the countless items you should consider according to your lifestyle, budget and particulars.</p>
